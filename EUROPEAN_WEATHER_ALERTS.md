This new function is only available for Geographical European users and is based on warning data published by Meteoalarm.

Settings can be found in the web services section of the Weather34 settings page. To ascertain your own alerts location go to https://www.meteoalarm.eu and select your country and region from the map and make a note of the the URL that you arrive at. From this URL you will see your country and region codes.

      For example, the URL for the UK London and South East region is https://www.meteoalarm.eu/en_UK/0/0/UK013-London%20&%20South%20East.html
      From this URL the key piece of information is UK013. Splitting this into UK and 013, produces the country code and region code. The other two pieces of information required by the Weather34 settings page are Update Frequency and local network IP address of the device that is running the software. Include the port address if it is not the default 80. You will also need to select a webservice code string which includes which includes 'al'
      
After clicking on save, restart WeeWX to prime the new service.

When an alert is force, a brief description and either a yellow, orange or red warning triangle will appear in the top row advisory module. Clicking on the alert will activate a pop-up window with more details of the alert(s) either in force or about to be in force.

I would welcome Weather34 users' input to code interfaces for othe weather alert systems in othe parts of the Globe to make this a complete service.

Below is a copy of an e-mail to Ken True of saratoga-weather.com outlining the conditions that are required by EUMETNET - MeteoAlarm for public use of the data.
